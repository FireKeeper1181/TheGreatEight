            <h1>Hurricane Katrina</h1>

            <div class="event-details">
                <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p>
                    Hurricane Katrina was one of the most catastrophic and destructive hurricanes in the history of the
                    United States. It struck the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, causing widespread devastation in
                    several
                    states, particularly Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
                </p>

                <h2>Formation and Landfall:</h2>
                <p>
                    Katrina started as a tropical depression over the Bahamas and gained strength rapidly as it moved
                    towards the Gulf of Mexico. By the time it made landfall, it had intensified into a Category 3
                    hurricane with sustained winds of around 125 mph (200 km/h).
                </p>

                <h2>Impact on New Orleans:</h2>
                <p>
                    The city of New Orleans bore the brunt of Katrina's impact. The hurricane caused multiple levee
                    breaches in New Orleans, leading to catastrophic flooding in around 80% of the city. The failure of
                    the
                    levee system resulted in massive inundation, leaving thousands of residents stranded on rooftops or
                    seeking refuge in overcrowded shelters.
                </p>

                <h2>Aftermath and Humanitarian Crises:</h2>
                <p>
                    The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was marked by a series of significant humanitarian crises.
                    Thousands of people were left homeless, infrastructure was severely damaged, and communication
                    systems were disrupted. The response from federal, state, and local authorities was widely
                    criticized
                    for being slow and inadequate.
                </p>

                <h2>Death Toll and Impact:</h2>
                <p>
                    The total death toll attributed to Hurricane Katrina exceeded 1,800 people, making it one of the
                    deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history. Many victims drowned in the floodwaters, while others
                    died due to lack of medical care, exposure, or other related causes in the storm's aftermath.
                </p>

                <h2>Environmental and Economic Impact:</h2>
                <p>
                    The environmental and economic impact of Katrina was staggering. Homes and businesses were
                    destroyed,
                    the coastal ecosystem was significantly damaged, and the cost of recovery and rebuilding amounted to
                    billions of dollars.
                </p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned and Ongoing Efforts:</h2>
                <p>
                    In the wake of Katrina, there were extensive discussions and debates about disaster preparedness,
                    emergency response, and the role of government at various levels in handling such large-scale
                    natural
                    disasters. Efforts to rebuild and revitalize affected areas have been ongoing for years, with a
                    focus
                    on improving infrastructure, enhancing emergency preparedness, and addressing the long-term economic
                    and
                    social impacts left by Hurricane Katrina.
