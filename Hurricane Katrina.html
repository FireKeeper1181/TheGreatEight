            <h1>Soviet Famine - Holodomor</h1>

            <div class="event-details">
                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                <p>
                    The Soviet Famine, often referred to as the Holodomor, was a devastating period of famine that
                    occurred
                    in the Soviet Union, particularly affecting Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and parts of Russia
                    between 1932
                    and 1933. This catastrophic event resulted in the deaths of millions of people due to starvation,
                    malnutrition, and related diseases.
                </p>

                <h2>Causes:</h2>
                <p>
                    The causes of the Soviet Famine were primarily man-made, resulting from the policies implemented by
                    the Soviet government, specifically under the leadership of Joseph Stalin. Stalin's collectivization
                    and agricultural policies aimed to forcibly consolidate small, individual farms into large,
                    state-controlled collective farms. This process aimed to increase agricultural productivity and feed
                    industrial workers in rapidly growing urban areas.
                </p>

                <h2>Resistance and Violent Confiscation:</h2>
                <p>
                    However, the implementation of collectivization led to widespread resistance among the farming
                    communities. Peasants resisted giving up their land and livestock, which resulted in violent
                    confiscation by Soviet authorities. In response to this resistance, Stalin's regime initiated a
                    series
                    of harsh measures to enforce collectivization, including confiscation of grain and other foodstuffs
                    from the peasantry.
                </p>

                <h2>Quotas and Labeling of "Kulaks":</h2>
                <p>
                    The Soviet government imposed impossibly high quotas on grain requisitions, leaving little to no
                    food
                    for the farmers and their families. Peasants who were deemed resistant to collectivization or unable
                    to meet the grain quotas were labelled as "kulaks" (wealthy peasants) and were either executed,
                    deported, or left to starve. This deliberate policy of seizing agricultural produce and preventing
                    its
                    distribution to affected regions exacerbated the famine.
                </p>

                <h2>Denial and Censorship:</h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of people died because of starvation and related illnesses during the Soviet Famine.
                    However,
                    the Soviet government denied the existence of the famine, censored information, and restricted
                    access
                    to affected areas. Foreign journalists and aid organizations were barred from entering the affected
                    regions, and the Soviet authorities actively suppressed any information about the famine both
                    domestically and internationally.
                </p>

                <h2>Controversies and Ongoing Debates:</h2>
                <p>
                    The Soviet Famine remains a contentious and sensitive topic, with ongoing debates about the exact
                    number of casualties and the extent to which it was deliberately engineered as a tool of political
                    repression. While estimates vary, it is widely acknowledged as one of the most tragic and
                    devastating
                    man-made disasters of the 20th century, with a profound and lasting impact on the affected regions
                    and
                    their populations.
