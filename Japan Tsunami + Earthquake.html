            <h1>Japan Tsunami + Earthquake</h1>

            <div class="event-details">
                <p><strong>Devastating Event:</strong> The Japan Tsunami and Earthquake occurred on [Date], leading to
                    widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>

                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The event resulted in massive destruction along coastal areas, triggering a
                    powerful tsunami that caused extensive damage and loss of life. The earthquake also caused
                    structural damage to buildings and infrastructure.</p>

                <p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Japan faced a long and challenging recovery process, involving
                    reconstruction efforts, assistance from the international community, and initiatives to enhance
                    preparedness for future natural disasters.</p>

                <h2>Key Details:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. The 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.9 and killed over 140,000 people.
                    </li>
                    <li>2. Great East Japan Earthquake (2011): One of the most devastating events in recent history was
                        the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011. It had a magnitude of 9.0-9.1,
                        making it the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan and the fourth most powerful
                        earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900. The earthquake triggered a
                        massive tsunami with waves reaching up to 40 meters (130 feet) in some areas. The tsunami led to
                        the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster when the waves inundated the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
                        Power Plant. This disaster had significant social, economic, and environmental consequences for
                        Japan</li>
                    <li>3. Kumamoto Earthquakes (2016): In April 2016, a series of earthquakes struck the Kumamoto
                        region in southwestern Japan. The mainshock, with a magnitude of 7.0, caused widespread damage
                        to buildings and infrastructure. A number of aftershocks followed, exacerbating the destruction.
                        The earthquakes affected thousands of people, leading to evacuations and disrupting daily life
                        in the affected areas.</li>
                    <li>4. Tohoku-Oki Earthquake (2013): In December 2012, a powerful undersea earthquake with a
                        magnitude of 7.3 occurred off the coast of Tohoku. Although it did not cause a tsunami, it
                        served as a reminder of the ongoing seismic activity in the region and the potential for future
                        events.Japan has a well-developed early warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis, and strict
                        building codes to minimize the damage caused by seismic events. Despite these measures, the
                        country remains vigilant and continues to invest in research and infrastructure to mitigate the
                        impact of earthquakes and tsunamis. The events mentioned are just a few examples, and Japan
                        regularly experiences smaller earthquakes due to its tectonic setting.</li>

                </ul>

                <p><strong>Resilience and Recovery:</strong> Despite the immense challenges, the people of Japan
                    demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of adversity. The recovery efforts showcased the
                    strength of community and international support.</p>
